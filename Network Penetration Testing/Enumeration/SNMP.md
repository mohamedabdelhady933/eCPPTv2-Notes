* SNMP attacks
  - Flooding
    - Flooding: DOS attack which involves spoofing an SNMP agent and flooding the SNMP trap management with tens of thousands of SNMP traps, varying in size from 50 bytes to 32 kilobytes, until the SNMP management trap is unable to function properly.
  - Community
    - Using Default community strings to gain privileged access to systems
  - Brute force

* SNMP Enumeration

Snmpwalk uses SNMP GETNEXT requests to query a network entity for a tree of information.

> snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.x.x 

> nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-win32-services 192.168.x.x          (get all services)

> nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-brute 192.168.x.x                   (get community string)

> nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-win32-users 192.168.x.x              (get users)
