# Privilege Escalation and Maintaining Access

* Types of privilege escalation
  - Vertical
    - The attacker is able to move from a lower privileged user to a higher privileged user. For example from a low-end user to administrator or root user.
  - Horizontal: 
    - The attacker keeps the same set or level of privileges but assumes the identity of a different user (he/she does not gain any further privilege).

### Maintaining Access

In this phase we will make sure that our session is :

+ Stable (does not get dropped)
  - One of the main issues when you get a meterpreter session on the target, is that the end user can kill the exploited process. It can happen, for example, when you exploit a client-side vulnerability through the web browser and the user just closes the web browser window.
+ Privileged (can run with high privileges)
+ Persistent (through reboots)
