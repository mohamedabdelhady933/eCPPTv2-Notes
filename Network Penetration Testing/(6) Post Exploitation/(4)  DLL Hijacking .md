#  DLL Hijacking 

DLL search order : is the order of directory paths that an application will lock for as it is launched as it looks for DLLs to import for its functionality.

* Flow

If we have process or exe file that call dll library , So the system search for the dll library path in main paths

1- The current directory ./

If not found 

2- In Windows directory C:\Windows\

If not found 

3- In system32 or system64 depend on the target running on 32 or 64 bit  C:\Windows\system32  |  C:\Windows\system64

So you can hijack the dll library to any the previous paths in order.
