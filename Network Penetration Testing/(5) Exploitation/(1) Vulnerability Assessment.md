The vulnerability assessment phase is aimed at building a list of the vulnerabilities present on target systems. The penetration tester has to carry out a vulnerability
assessment on each target found in the previous steps.

* Low Hanging Fruits (LHF)

that means the following 
1- Misconfigured servers
2- Unimplemented or badly implemented ACLâ€™s
3- Default or weak passwords (easily guessable)
4- Open SMB shares / Null sessions
5- Broadcast Requests
6- Vulnerabilities related to public exploits
and so on ...


* Ncrack

[Ncrack](http://nmap.org/ncrack/man.html) is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool that allows the testing of hosts and their services for poor password on common services.

1- Scan range

> ncrack 192.168.x.0/24

> ncrack 192.168.x.1-200

2- Scan domain or a specific IP

> ncrack domain.com

> ncrack 192.168.x.x

3- Scan a specific service

> ncrack telnet://192.168.x.x:25

> ncrack ssh://192.168.x.x

> ncrack ssh://192.168.x.x telnet://192.168.x2.x2:218

4- Scan range on multiple services

> ncrack 192.168.x.1,100 -p ssh:218,telnet
