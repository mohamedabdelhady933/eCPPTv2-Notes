# Exploitation

Metasploit is an exploitation framework that makes it very easy to access a library of exploits created by the community, in order to running them against vulnerable
targets.


* Windows Authentication Weaknesses

The authentication protocol used between Windows clients and servers is called [NTLM](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa378749(v=vs.85).aspx)  (NT LAN Manager). Although NTLM has been replaced by Kerberos, it is still
widely used and supported in Windows machines. For example, it is used either when the client is authenticating to a server using an IP address or, when the client is
authenticating to a server that does not belong to the same domain.

* NTLM

NTLM authentication is a challenge/response protocol and consists of three messages: Type 1 (negotiation), Type 2 (challenge) and Type 3 (authentication).

* How challenge/response works

1- The client sends the Type 1 message, which contains the username (in plaintext)

2- The server generates the challenge and sends it back to the client

3- The client encrypts the challenge with the hash of the user password and returns the results of the computation to the server
